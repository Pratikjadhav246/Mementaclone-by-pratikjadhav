        <div class="parentbox">
            <div class="child">
                <p>
                    We started off by developing custom built software applications in 2001 for factories.
            </p><p>        
                    ISO was then becoming popular and factories were required to measure various processes in order to improve them. Tool life, Machine OEE, Rejection ppm, Schedule versus Supply etc. were the buzz words.
                </p>
<p>We understood the requirements and evolved simple to use solutions. Our customers have been our best teachers and solving their problems has made OurSys a well rounded package.</p>
<p>By 2008, we had developed solutions fitting various kinds of industries such as precision machining, rubber, castings, forgings, sheet metal, machine builders, project based manufacturers etc. We then consolidated all these features into a single family of products and called it Oursys.</p>
<p>OurSys now caters to not only manufacturers but also traders, service providers, job workers, project companies many more.</p>
                <br><br>
<i>OurSys is one of the first ERP package to run over internet in a browser.</i>

            <p>OurSys was developed on the shopfloors of Indian SME companies. It has evolved by solving practical problems of the SME industry. 
                </p><p>
                        We totally understand the industry which has to meet tough international standards and at the same time learn to operate with low skill and unorganised suppliers.
                    </p><p>        
                        We had users who could barely read English or use computers and yet all the requirements of standards such as ISO, TS, AS, API etc had to be fulfilled. Thus OurSys evolved to be an extremely easy to use software and yet be compliant with all the prescribed best practices of the industry.
                    </p>
    <p>After almost 20 years we still continue to study ground level problems of customers and use the latest in technology to evolve simple solutions.</p>
    <p>We aspire to become a global brand in ERP system.</p>

                        <p>There are companies who want a good ERP system but are not able to give-up their friendly spreadsheets. They also find it difficult to see beyond their accounting packages.
                        But as the company grows, it becomes imminent to have a good ERP system.  </p>
                        
                            <p>There are some other companies who have modified accounting packages, bought off-the shelf ERPs and or dared to built a custom made system.
                            But very few are happy with their system.</p>
            
                        <p>Without a seasoned ERP provider, people drive at will and end up messing up their ERP. We at Momenta have the right experience to help you achieve your goals through OurSys.</p>
